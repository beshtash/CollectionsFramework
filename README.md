Counting hidden files with tree
In some cases, you may want to count hidden files on your system.

By default, whether you are using the “tree”, “find” or “ls” commands, hidden files won’t be printed in the terminal output.

In order to count hidden files using tree, you have to execute “tree” and append the “-a” option for “all”, followed by the directory to be analyzed.

This tutorial focuses on how to find files on Linux using the find and the locate command.

As a system administrator, it is a very common task to look for a specific file on your file system.

However, it might be sometimes hard to find files on a Linux filesystem especially if you have dozens of different users.

There are two commands that can help you achieve your goal : find and locate.

In this tutorial, we are going to see how to use those commands effectively and how they can be tuned to achieve what we are looking for.
